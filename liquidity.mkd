liquidity is the measure of how you can convert your assests into another assest with a fixed price without distrubing the market.

## For Example: 


# if the liquidity pool is small for shiba inu then:
if we convert 1 eth in to shib : it's price may vary or ( goese down) for 2/3 eth
#So the Heigher the liquidity pool will be the fixed price you can get for the swap
